# Differential Privacy for Mobile User Trajectories

## Overview

This repository contains our analyses on differentially private trajectory publishing algorithms.

## Dataset

The primary dataset used in this research is the **KTH wireless trace dataset**, obtained from CRAWDAD kth/campus. This dataset provides a rich, fine-grained collection of mobility traces, ideal for evaluating the effectiveness of differential privacy algorithms in a real-world context.
